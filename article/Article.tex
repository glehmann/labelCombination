\begin{abstract}
\noindent
Combining some labeled images is a quite common and useful task in image analysis.
That's something we may want to do to prepare the markers for a watershed from
markers for example, or to write the output of several segmentations in a single
file.
This article comes with three new filters to make the combination
of labeled images easier with ITK.
This contribution also try to provide a implementation much better integrated with the
ITK pipeline model than the itkMultipleUnlabeledImagesToLabeledImageFilter contribution.
\end{abstract}

\section{How to combine the labels from several images}

There are two major problems while combining the labels from several images:
\begin{itemize}
  \item avoiding the label collision. The input images may or may not compatibles labels.
  The labels may be modified to avoid the collision, but it might be necessary to know
  there exact value after the combination.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The labels must be kept unchanged. The user must take care to avoid the collisions
    by himself.
    \item The labels can be modified, but the user must be able to identify them easily. The
    simplest solution is to shift the label values according to the image number.
    \item The labels can be fully modified. The images will be relabeled, all the first labels
    will come from the first image, the next ones from the second image, etc. This method also
    produce consecutive labels - often a desirable feature.
  \end{itemize}

  \item avoiding the labeled region collision. This is a much simple problem: an exception
  can be throws when a collision occure, or we can choose to give a higher priority to a
  label than the others. For this last point, the value of the label don't seem to be a good choice
  because the labels are not supposed to be ordered. A better choice seems to be the image
  number. By convention, let say that's the label from the last image.
  
\end{itemize}


\section{Class description an usage examples}

All the new filters provided with that article are subclassing the NaryFunctorImageFilter, or
are implementing a similar interface. They all take one or more images as input, and produce a
single output image.

They also provide the SetIgnoreCollision(bool) method which let the user choose to ignore the
labeled region collision or not. By default, they are ignored.

Finally, they all provide the SetBackgroundValue(OutputPixelType) wich let the user set the
value of the background label.

\subsection{NaryLabelImageFilter}

This filter take all the labels which are not background pixels in all the input images, and
put them in the output image. The labels may be shifted on a per image basis, by calling
SetShift(OutputPixelType) with a value different of 0. By default, the labels are not shifted.

#include "itkImageFileReader.h"
#include "itkImageFileWriter.h"
#include "itkCommand.h"
#include "itkSimpleFilterWatcher.h"

#include "itkNaryLabelImageFilter.h"


int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{

  if( argc != 7 )
    {
    std::cerr << "usage: " << argv[0] << " input1 input2 output bg shift collision" << std::endl;
    // std::cerr << "  : " << std::endl;
    exit(1);
    }

  const int dim = 2;
  
  typedef unsigned char PType;
  typedef itk::Image< PType, dim > IType;

  typedef itk::ImageFileReader< IType > ReaderType;
  ReaderType::Pointer reader1 = ReaderType::New();
  reader1->SetFileName( argv[1] );

  ReaderType::Pointer reader2 = ReaderType::New();
  reader2->SetFileName( argv[2] );

  typedef itk::NaryLabelImageFilter< IType, IType > FilterType;
  FilterType::Pointer filter = FilterType::New();
  filter->SetInput( 0, reader1->GetOutput() );
  filter->SetInput( 1, reader2->GetOutput() );
  filter->SetBackgroundValue( atoi(argv[4]) );
  filter->SetShift( atoi(argv[5]) );
  filter->SetIgnoreCollision( atoi(argv[6]) );

  itk::SimpleFilterWatcher watcher(filter, "filter");

  typedef itk::ImageFileWriter< IType > WriterType;

  writer->SetInput( filter->GetOutput() );
  writer->SetFileName( argv[3] );
  writer->Update();

  return 0;
}
\end{verbatim} \normalsize



\subsection{NaryRelabelImageFilter}

This filter search all the label in the image, and give them a new value so they are all
consecutive. It then do the same with the second image, and give them the labels immediately
after the ones of the first image. It then do the same with the third image, etc.
The new labels are then copied to the output image.
Contrary to the previous filter, the user can't easily identify a label in the input image.
However, he is sure to get no label collision, and only consecutive labels in the output image
(if there is no labeled region collision).

\small \begin{verbatim}
#include "itkImageFileReader.h"
#include "itkImageFileWriter.h"
#include "itkCommand.h"
#include "itkSimpleFilterWatcher.h"

#include "itkNaryRelabelImageFilter.h"


int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{

  if( argc != 6 )
    {
    std::cerr << "usage: " << argv[0] << " input1 input2 output bg collision" << std::endl;
    // std::cerr << "  : " << std::endl;
    exit(1);
    }

  const int dim = 2;
  
  typedef unsigned char PType;
  typedef itk::Image< PType, dim > IType;

  typedef itk::ImageFileReader< IType > ReaderType;
  ReaderType::Pointer reader1 = ReaderType::New();
  reader1->SetFileName( argv[1] );

  ReaderType::Pointer reader2 = ReaderType::New();
  reader2->SetFileName( argv[2] );

  typedef itk::NaryRelabelImageFilter< IType, IType > FilterType;
  FilterType::Pointer filter = FilterType::New();
  filter->SetInput( 0, reader1->GetOutput() );
  filter->SetInput( 1, reader2->GetOutput() );
  filter->SetBackgroundValue( atoi(argv[4]) );
  filter->SetIgnoreCollision( atoi(argv[5]) );

  itk::SimpleFilterWatcher watcher(filter, "filter");

  typedef itk::ImageFileWriter< IType > WriterType;
  WriterType::Pointer writer = WriterType::New();
  writer->SetInput( filter->GetOutput() );
  writer->SetFileName( argv[3] );
  writer->Update();

  return 0;
}
\end{verbatim} \normalsize


\subsection{NaryBinaryToLabelImageFilter}

This filter in very similar to the previous one, but for binary images. Only the pixels with
the value set with SetForegroundValue(InputImageType) are considered to be an object. The other
are background.

\small \begin{verbatim}
#include "itkImageFileReader.h"
#include "itkImageFileWriter.h"
#include "itkCommand.h"
#include "itkSimpleFilterWatcher.h"

#include "itkNaryBinaryToLabelImageFilter.h"


int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{

  if( argc != 7 )
    {
    std::cerr << "usage: " << argv[0] << " input1 input2 output bg fg collision" << std::endl;
    // std::cerr << "  : " << std::endl;
    exit(1);
    }

  const int dim = 2;
  
  typedef unsigned char PType;
  typedef itk::Image< PType, dim > IType;

  typedef itk::ImageFileReader< IType > ReaderType;
  ReaderType::Pointer reader1 = ReaderType::New();
  reader1->SetFileName( argv[1] );

  ReaderType::Pointer reader2 = ReaderType::New();
  reader2->SetFileName( argv[2] );

  typedef itk::NaryBinaryToLabelImageFilter< IType, IType > FilterType;
  FilterType::Pointer filter = FilterType::New();
  filter->SetInput( 0, reader1->GetOutput() );
  filter->SetInput( 1, reader2->GetOutput() );
  filter->SetBackgroundValue( atoi(argv[4]) );
  filter->SetForegroundValue( atoi(argv[5]) );
  filter->SetIgnoreCollision( atoi(argv[6]) );

  itk::SimpleFilterWatcher watcher(filter, "filter");

  typedef itk::ImageFileWriter< IType > WriterType;
  WriterType::Pointer writer = WriterType::New();
  writer->SetInput( filter->GetOutput() );
  writer->SetFileName( argv[3] );
  writer->Update();

  return 0;
}

\section{Wrappers}

As usual, the wrappers for WrapITK are provided with the sources, and have been sucessfully
tested with python.
